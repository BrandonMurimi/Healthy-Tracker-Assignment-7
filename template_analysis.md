Justification for Selecting Automated Kanban
For our Health Tracker System, I recommend the Automated Kanban template because:

1-Agile Alignment:

Perfectly matches our sprint-based workflow from Assignments 5-6

Supports continuous delivery of features like step tracking and data visualization

2-Time-Saving Automation:

Automatic movement of issues between columns (e.g., moves to "Done" when PRs are merged)

Reduces manual board maintenance for our small team

3-Customization Potential:

Easily adaptable to add columns like "Testing" and "Blocked"

Supports labeling system for features (US-001 to US-010) and bugs

4-Integration Benefits:

Directly links to our existing GitHub Issues for user stories

Shows real-time development progress without additional tools

5-Visual Clarity:

Clear workflow stages match our development process

Enforces WIP limits to prevent bottlenecks in our 2-week sprints
