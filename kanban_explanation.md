## Kanban Board Overview

**Definition:**
A Kanban board is a visual workflow management tool that tracks work items across stages of completion.

**Our Implementation:**

1. **Workflow Visualization**:
   - Columns represent development stages
   - Card colors indicate priority (red=high, yellow=medium, green=low)
   - Progress is immediately visible

2. **WIP Limits**:
   - Max 3 tasks in "In Progress"
   - Max 2 tasks in "Ready for QA"
   - Prevents team overload

3. **Agile Support**:
   - Continuous Delivery: QA column ensures quality
   - Adaptability: Easy to reprioritize
   - Transparency: Clear status for all stakeholders
